### **Introduction to Cloud Computing**

**Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

---

### **Key Concepts**

#### 1. **What Is the Cloud?**

Instead of owning your own computing infrastructure or data centers, you can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.

---

### **Types of Cloud Environments**

* **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud).
* **Private Cloud**: Cloud infrastructure used exclusively by a single organization.
* **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines both public and private clouds to allow data and applications to move between them.

---

### **Cloud Service Models**

1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**

   * Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
   * Example: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine
   * Users manage: OS, applications, data
2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**

   * Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with infrastructure.
   * Example: Google App Engine, Heroku
3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

   * Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
   * Example: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Dropbox


### **Introduction to AWS Cloud**

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is the world’s most comprehensive and widely adopted **cloud platform**, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. It enables businesses and developers to build scalable, secure, and cost-effective solutions using the cloud.

### **What is AWS?**

AWS is a **public cloud** platform provided by Amazon. It offers services for computing power, storage, databases, networking, machine learning, analytics, security, and more—available on-demand via the internet.

---

### **Key Features of AWS**

* **On-demand access**: Use resources as needed without upfront investment.
* **Global infrastructure**: Operates in many geographic regions and availability zones.
* **Pay-as-you-go pricing**: Pay only for what you use.
* **High scalability**: Easily increase or decrease resources.
* **Security**: Compliant with major industry standards (e.g., ISO, SOC, HIPAA).

### **Popular AWS Services**

Here are some of the most commonly used AWS services, grouped by category:

#### **1. Compute**

* **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Virtual servers in the cloud.
* **Lambda**: Serverless computing—run code without managing servers.

#### **2. Storage**

* **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Scalable object storage for files, backups, and data lakes.
* **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Storage volumes attached to EC2 instances.

#### **3. Databases**

* **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
* **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database service.

#### **4. Networking**

* **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Isolated network within the AWS cloud.
* **Route 53**: Scalable domain name system (DNS) service.

#### **5. Security & Identity**

* **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Control access to AWS services.
* **KMS (Key Management Service)**: Manage encryption keys.

### **How to Get Started with AWS**

1. **Create an AWS account** at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com).
2. **Access the AWS Management Console** – a web-based user interface to manage AWS resources.
3. **Use Free Tier**: AWS offers a free usage tier to explore many services at no cost.
4. **Launch your first service**: Start with an S3 bucket or an EC2 virtual server.

### **Common Use Cases**

* Hosting websites and web apps
* Backup and storage
* Big data processing
* Machine learning
* Game development
* IoT applications
